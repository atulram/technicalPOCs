React will only work for the root element (the element we specify), thus its a library(working on small part of your code)

__npm__
- package.json is the configuration for npm
- ^1.1.1 indicates minor and patch version can change (<2.0.0)
- ~1.1.1 indicate on patch verssion can change (<1.2.0)

- Every dependency in node_modules has its own package.josn
- The purpose of package-lock.json is to ensure that the same dependencies are installed consistently across different environments
- If package-lock.json is present, dependencies are installed from it
- We push package-lock.json for apllication to github
- Dependencies dont push their package-lock.json
- Node_modules are not pushed
- devDependencies doesn't go to production code (install with production flag)
- Anything in the script section can be run using `npm run`, start key doesn't need run, `npm start` will do

To execute a package with npm you either have to type the local path, like this:

`$ ./node_modules/.bin/your-package` 
    
or you can run a locally installed package by adding it into your package.json file in the scripts section, like this:

`{
    "name": "your-application",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scripts": {
        "your-package": "your-package"
     }
}`

Then you can run the script using npm run:
    
`npm run your-package`

With npx

If you wish to execute a locally installed package, all you need to do is type:
    
`npx your-package`
    
npx will check whether _command_ or _package_ (node_modules .bin folder has commands scripts or binary packages) exists in $PATH, or in the local project binaries, and if so it will execute it.

Another major advantage is the ability to execute a package that wasnâ€™t previously installed
    
`npx cowsay wow`

`npx create-react-app myproj`

__modules__

- [Read this DigitalOcean blog on module completely](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-modules-and-import-and-export-statements-in-javascript)
- ECMAScript 2015 supports the use of JavaScript modules.

- In order to ensure this code gets loaded as a module and not a regular script, add type="module" to the script tags in index.html. Any code that uses import or export must use this attribute

- Modules are different from regular scripts in a few ways:

    - Modules do not add anything to the global (window) scope.
    - Modules always are in strict mode.
    - Loading the same module twice in the same file will have no effect, as modules are only executed once.
    - Modules require a server environment.
