React will only work for the root element (the element we specify), thus its a library(working on small part of your code)

__npm__
- package.json is the configuration for npm
- ^1.1.1 indicates minor and patch version can change (<2.0.0)
- ~1.1.1 indicate on patch verssion can change (<1.2.0)

- Every dependency in node_modules has its own package.josn
- The purpose of package-lock.json is to ensure that the same dependencies are installed consistently across different environments
- If package-lock.json is present, dependencies are installed from it
- We push package-lock.json for apllication to github
- Dependencies dont push their package-lock.json
- Node_modules are not pushed
- devDependencies doesn't go to production code (install with production flag)
- Anything in the script section can be run using `npm run`, start key doesn't need run, `npm start` will do

[__npx__](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)

To execute a package with npm you either have to type the local path, like this:

`$ ./node_modules/.bin/your-package` 

like 

.`\node_modules\.bin\parcel .\index.html`
    
or you can run a locally installed package by adding it into your package.json file in the scripts section, like this:

    `{
        "name": "your-application",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "scripts": {
            "your-package": "your-package"
        }
    }`

Then you can run the script using npm run:
    
`npm run your-package`

With npx

If you wish to execute a locally installed package, all you need to do is type:
    
`npx your-package`
    
npx will check whether _command_ or _package_ (node_modules .bin folder has commands scripts or binary packages) exists in $PATH, or in the local project binaries, and if so it will execute it.

Another major advantage is the ability to execute a package that wasnâ€™t previously installed
    
`npx cowsay wow`

`npx create-react-app myproj`

__modules__

- [Read this DigitalOcean blog on module completely](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-modules-and-import-and-export-statements-in-javascript)
- ECMAScript 2015 supports the use of JavaScript modules.

- In order to ensure this code gets loaded as a module and not a regular script, add type="module" to the script tags in index.html. Any code that uses import or export must use this attribute

- Modules are different from regular scripts in a few ways:

    - Modules do not add anything to the global (window) scope.
    - Modules always are in strict mode.
    - Loading the same module twice in the same file will have no effect, as modules are only executed once.
    - Modules require a server environment.

**React** can be injected to our code by cdn links like below

    <body>
    <!-- top and bottom elements of root will not be replaced by react  --
    
    <div id="root"></div> <!-- anything inside root will be replaced by react  -->
    
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>

This makes a network call to fetch the react scripts so not recommended

Another way is to use react as a dependency in our project

`npm i react`

`npm i react-dom`

in the app.js import react and react-dom. Since we are importing in app.js it should be decalred as module while sourcing in the html

    <script type='module' src="app.js"></script>

__Pacrcel Bundler__

- Dev and Prod build
- Local server
- HMR (hot module reloading)
- File watch algo
- Caching
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Code splitting
- Differential bundling for browser support
- Tree Shaking
- HTTPs
- Diagnostics

and a lot more, explore the [documentation](https://parceljs.org/docs/) for more

bundlers like parcel plays a key role in making our react app faster, performant and optimized

`npx parcel index.html` <--entrypoint

`npx parcel build index.html` <-- for prod build, need to remove the main field from package.json

We can add 

    "browserslist": [
       "last 2 versions"
    ]
 in the package.json and parcel build will take into account this list of browsers and our app will definately work on these browsers, explore [browserlist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for more

npm scripts convention

    "scripts": {
        "start": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html",
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },

    npm run start / npm start is for runnning in dev mode
    npm run build is for prod build


crossorigin tag 

Normal script elements pass minimal information to the window.onerror for scripts which do not pass the standard CORS checks. To allow error logging for sites which use a separate domain for static media, use this attribute. See CORS settings attributes for a more descriptive explanation of its valid arguments.

__React__

    const heading = React.createElement('h1', {"id": "headr", "a": "b"}, 'I am h1 tag')

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))

    root.render(heading)

React.createElement returns => obj => render() makes this an HTML element

Object
![Alt text](image.png)

HTML element
![Alt text](image-1.png)

render will replace everything in the root element and not append
