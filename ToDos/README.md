A distributed system needs to reach a consensus on what the actual state is. etcd uses the RAFT consensus
algorithm to achieve this, which ensures that at any given moment, each nodeâ€™s state is
either what the majority of the nodes agrees is the current state or is one of the previously agreed upon states.
